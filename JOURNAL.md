Ive been pondering the idea of making something like this for quite a while, i even ordered a few servos for projects earlier this month, though they haven't arrived yet. I figured this would be a good idea since M5stack sells a kit that does something similar so i know its within the realm of possibility, but I decided that I wanted to add my own flair to it by giving it thermal vision and making it a tank.
