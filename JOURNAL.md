## 10/21/2025 - I doodled a basic design

Ive been pondering the idea of making something like this for quite a while, i even ordered a few servos for projects earlier this month, though they haven't arrived yet. I figured this would be a good idea since M5stack sells a kit that does something similar so i know its within the realm of possibility, but I decided that I wanted to add my own flair to it by giving it thermal vision and making it a tank.  

## 10/22/2025 - Research before i can start modeling  

I cannot say that this is going very well at this point in time.

My current largest problem is a need for a power system for the servos, since they take 5 volts and i cannot find any combination of batteries that adds up to that. From the sounds of it im going to need something called a "buck converter" though i am worried since i do not own a multimeter and cannot verify that the voltage coming out will be correct. I still need to do more research on what kind of battery will best fit this scenario, since it needs a somewhat high amount of current, especially since i decided to go up to 4 servos and make it larger all around to help handle the sheer size of batteries.

Here is a physical outline of the new shape that i made so i could reference it

As well as this obligatory picture of my very eepy research buddy

Things to do in the near future:

- decide on a type of battery (from my research it sounds like it needs to be able to supply around 3 amps
- decide how to secure said batteries
start to cad out the shapes of the individual components
